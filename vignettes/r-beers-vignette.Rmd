The Beers interpolation is used particularly in demographic interpolation, where
frequently it is necessary to interpolate 5-yearly data, down to single year points.
Standard UNWPP population data for instance, is 5-yearly in its native representation,
but UNWPP use the Beers ordinary method (among other transformations) to produce
the interpolated data.

## Installation

# install.package("r-beers")
